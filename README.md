# cryptogram-assistant-app

This app lets you type a cryptogram into the text box. A cryptogram is a code where each letter of the alphabet represents a letter of the solution. Then it will format the cryptogram so that you can solve it easily.

You can type a letter into a box, and all of the same letter will populate. You can keep track of the frequency of letters in the cryptogram, or you can hide that info.

If you type a space into a box, all letters of that category will be erased.

You can also try one of our cryptograms.

You can move to the next letter using the tab key, or you can select a box with the mouse/trackpad.
